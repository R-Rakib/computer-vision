### Tips and Hints

- Before contributing, **if it's your first time**, please read the general [contribution guide](https://huggingface2.notion.site/Contribution-Guide-19411c29298644df8e9656af45a7686d?pvs=4).

- If you have any **bigger assets like datasets, models, custom demos**, please store them in [this Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hf-vision/course-assets) to keep this repository lightweight. You can ask for an access to the organization if you aren't a part of it yet.

- For an easier collaboration when **working on notebooks together**, feel free to use [ReviewNB](https://www.reviewnb.com/), which is free for open-source and educational use cases.

- In the requirements.txt file you can find some packages that can be helpful when creating the material. As we're originating from the HuggingFace community, we can recommend using the  [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/), [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/), [evaluate](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/) and [timm](https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/) libraries.
