# Transfer Learning / Fine Tuning for Multimodal Models

In this directory, you can find multiple notebooks that introduce you how to fine-tuning Multimodal models to downstream task like:
 - Image-to-Text / Text-to-Image
 - Document Classification
 - Visual Document Question Answering 
 - Form Understanding, etc.

We use different type of Multimodal Models ranging from:
 - LayoutLM family
 - DETR
 - DiT, etc.

This would include also the setup for training, fine-tuning and inferencing at the end. Feel free to use as sources for your project.
