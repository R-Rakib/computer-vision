# Document Image Classification

Document Image Classification is a downstream task for multimodal models that combines text and image as an input. More on the topic can be found here:  [Document AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08609).

The goal is to create a model that is able to classify the type of document based on an input image and a list of different labels.

This folder contains the fine-tuning and inference using different multimodal models. Refer to the list below for more information.
