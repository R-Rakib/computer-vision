# Transfer Learning / Fine Tuning for Multimodal Models
In this directory, you can find multiple notebooks that introduce how to fine-tune Multimodal models to downstream task like:
 - Image-to-Text / Text-to-Image
 - Document Classification
 - Visual Question Answering 
 - Speech-to-Text
 - Text-to-Vide

We have also included sources on state-of-the-art (SOTA) and current developments in multimodal models, providing you with the most up-to-date information in this field..

This also includes the setup for fine-tuning and running inference at the end. Feel free to use them as sources for your project.

We are continuously improving and expanding our collection of notebooks and resources. If you have any suggestions for additional models or tasks that you'd like us to explore, please create an issue, and we'll investigate the possibilities.

Let's dive into the notebooks to see how we can use fine-tuning and transfer learning to enhance multimodal models for various tasks. If you have any questions or ideas, don't hesitate to reach out.
